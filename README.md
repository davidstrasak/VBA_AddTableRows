# VBA_AddTableRows
This is a function that always adds a row to the end of an excel table so the users have a nicer experience using it. Truly a quality of life improvement.

Add it to your sheetX (X stands for a number) VBA directory to have nicer user experience aswell (make sure to change up the values though).
